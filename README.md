The files contained in this repository contain solutions to the first five problems from the Project Euler website:

http://projecteuler.net/

The five problems are a programming exercise for my application with Big Astronaut:

Each problem has an associated spec file, which tests each problem against two solutions.

The five problems I completed are:

* Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5
* Problem 2: Even Fibonacci numbers
* Problem 3: Largest prime factor
* Problem 4: Largest palindrome product
* Problem 5: Smallest multiple
